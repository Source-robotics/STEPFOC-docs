# Bilateral teleoperation guide


## **What is bilateral teleoperation?**
Bilateral teleoperation is a concept that Involves two-way communication where both the operator and the remote device send and receive feedback. The operator controls the device remotely and receives sensory feedback (such as force) from the device to adjust their actions.

The two grippers are virtually coupled to each other, allowing either to act as the master (the haptic interface) or the slave (the manipulator) in the system. We are not using a force sensor at the grippers but are relying on proprioception.

!!! Note annotate "**What is this used for?**" 
    These kind of setup is perfect for: Teleoperation, Imitation learning, Virtual Environments...

## **The algorithm**
The magic of this setup is done with these 2 simple formulas.

 We got them from amazing Ben Katz paper, creator of mini cheetah quad: [Link to the paper](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/118671?show=full)

 𝜏1,𝑖 = 𝐾𝑝(𝜃2,𝑖 − 𝜃1, 𝑖) + 𝐾𝑑( ˙𝜃2,𝑖 − ˙𝜃1,𝑖) − 𝐾( ˙𝜃1,𝑖)

 𝜏2,𝑖 = 𝐾𝑝(𝜃1,𝑖 − 𝜃2, 𝑖) + 𝐾𝑑( ˙𝜃1,𝑖 − ˙𝜃2,𝑖) − 𝐾( ˙𝜃2,𝑖)

## **What you will need**

We recommend these items to create a simple test jig:

* 2 x spectral micro BLDC - used for 2 wheels 
* Wires to connect everything up: [CAN wires](https://source-robotics.com/products/spectral-micro-can-cable), [Power wires](https://source-robotics.com/products/spectral-micro-power-cable)
* 2 x BLDC motors or SSG48 grippers
* 1 x [CAN adapter](https://source-robotics.com/products/canvas-usb-to-can-adapter)
* 1 x 24V power supply
* A Laptop or raspberry pi
* [UART adapter](https://source-robotics.com/products/usb-to-serial-adapter)

## **Setup**

Here we are showing you the setup for any 2 motors, for example we are using 2 x [ssg48 grippers](https://source-robotics.com/products/compliant-gripper) that are connected in exactly the same setup.

You will need to follow the diagram above to wire everything up.

* First you need to calibrate your Spectral BLDC drivers with the motors you are using. 
* After that change the CAN ids of one of the drivers to CAN 1. You can do it by using UART commands: #CANID 1 and after that #Save
* Now connect CAN adapters CAN bus to one of the drivers and then from that driver connect to the second driver. Make sure that last driver in chain has its CAN termination resistor in "ON" state
* Connect the power to both drivers. You can daisy chain it or use 2 seperate wires.

## **The code**

This code will run on your PC and it will communicate with the drivers from the CAN adapter.
