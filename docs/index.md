!!! Note annotate "**Spectral micro BLDC driver and STEPFOC driver**" 
    **STEPFOC stepper driver is built on the same hardware and software foundation as the Spectral Micro BLDC driver. As a result, some references or images in this documentation may still show the Spectral Micro, since both drivers share about 99% of their features. They also use the same CAN and UART command sets, with only minor differences in UART-based calibration and setup procedures.** <br />

 **STEPFOC driver is in beta stage and docs and firmware are under constant development!**

**Soon for sale**
