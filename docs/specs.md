# **STEPFOC datasheet**

!!! Note annotate "**Spectral micro BLDC driver and STEPFOC driver**" 
    **STEPFOC stepper driver is built on the same hardware and software foundation as the Spectral Micro BLDC driver. As a result, some references or images in this documentation may still show the Spectral Micro, since both drivers share about 99% of their features. They also use the same CAN and UART command sets, with only minor differences in UART-based calibration and setup procedures.** <br />

**STEPFOC** is a FOC based stepper motor controller designed to deliver affordable, high-performance hardware paired with powerful open-source software. Its mission is to transform low-cost stepper motors into high-performance robotic servos, enabling advanced robotics applications without the high price tag.

The controller features a 14-bit magnetic encoder, inline current sensing, CAN and UART interfaces, and supports position, velocity, torque, and impedance control modes — everything you need to build precise and capable robotic systems.

Optimized for NEMA17 stepper motors, STEPFOC provides a complete solution for robotics development.

!!! Note annotate "Note!" 

    * termistor pin is using pulldown of 54.9 kilo ohms. 
    * UART is 3v3 only. Using 5V will destroy the board.
    * "ADDITIONAL2" can be used as analog input or general purpose input/output
